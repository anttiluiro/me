                  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>In September 8th 1993 I was born to a family of two engineer parents and a two year old sister in Tampere.
                      My parents have told me a story that as a toddler I crawled in front of a mirror, kissed my reflection and laughed.
                      It was a silly act, but maybe being ok with myself from the very early years has helped me accept other
                      people as they are later on in life. This, I think, is one of my most valuable qualities I carry with me today.

              <p>
                My family moved to Espoo when I was three, and that’s where I feel my story really begins.
                I quickly befriended a group of people who lived near me, who were my first real friends. Together we went to kindergarten,
                primary school, junior high, and high school, played soccer, wondered what we’ll be when we grow up,
                partied in high school, worried about university entrance exams and all the other things related to growing up, you know the drill. While some people left
                or came in the group during this time, the resulting group is still something I value greatly.
                Many of us have ended up in different fields of studies, different cities, but we have stayed in touch regardless.

              <p>
                When I came to study Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University,
                I really noticed how careless and stressfree life I had lived until then.
                I didn’t have big ambitions, we were taking things rather easy with my friends,
                and my only plan was basically to graduate as an engineer and have a family.
                <br><br>
                But, something happened here at Aalto. I was suddenly surrounded by people with ambition and goals,
                and I quickly started to like the atmosphere and felt inspired. It was a crash course to working hard towards long-term goals,
                and after a few years of studying I have more drive and ambition than ever before.
                Now I know I’m able to do things and achieve goals I might initially feel are out of my reach,
                and working towards these goals and learning on the way has become one of my biggest motivators.
                In the process, I've also found my amazing girlfriend Jane.

                <h2>Why Storytelling?</h2>
                <p>
                  I think great things are achieved together, not alone. If you were to inspire others to work for the same goals with you,
                  you need to be able to communicate where you're coming from. And not only communicate, you need to make others
                  feel the emotions you do.
                  <br><br>
                  I used to hate giving presentations, both about school projects or presenting answers in class.
                  Shaking hands, stuttered words, and all that made my experiences of it awful. You probably know the feeling.
                  You probably also know the feeling of failure, the feeling that you messed something up. That's exactly what I felt.
                  But I knew I needed the skill,
                  and put effort to embracing the fear of giving presentation by jumping at the chance to do so.
                  <br><br>
                  After a few years of training, the situation has almost flipped upside down. Now I really enjoy giving presentations,
                  and in addition to having gotten feedback about being a natural presenter, I personally feel that I'm already good
                  at it, at least in terms of enjoying it and being clear with my message. However, I've started to feel that this
                  isn't enough. I think I have a lot to improve in making the audience enjoy and embrace my story, and I think now is a great time
                  to do that when I've built a solid base to build on. I feel this Storytelling course is a great way to kickstart my
                  learning of storytelling.
